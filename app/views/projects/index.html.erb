                <br>
                Using the ‘RIST HOMES’ technology, it is proposed to build about 15,000 homes in Haiti. The world is well aware of the humongous human tragedy that befell this nation in the January of 2010. Hundreds of thousands of Haitians are still living in tents, which cannot stand another natural disaster such as a quake, or a hurricane. RIST HOMES is a technology, which, among other things, has quake, and hurricane-proof elements in it, which are very important in the Haitian context. Additionally, these homes must be built quickly, and must be capable of adapting themselves to the Haitian environment of extreme heat, lack of grid-supplied electricity, lack of municipally supplied water, and sewage systems. 
                Our technology is ideally suited for such a harsh environment. Our first phase of 1,100 homes is in the making in the Crois-de-Bouquet area. Even in this small community of only 1,100 homes, we are providing for a church, school, medical clinic, and shopping center. Water, and sewage are handled via our proprietary systems that are based on our concept of ‘zero discharge of water intake, or output’.             </p>

                <h1>Kenya</h1>
                <br>
                Using ‘RIST HOMES’ concept, we are building about 2,000 homes as the first phase of a 20,000 home multi-site development. Due to the rapid nature of our construction process, it is expected that the delivery of these homes will take place within a year of beginning of construction. Apart from all the other features of our system, such as speed, cost efficiency, quake-proofness, unitary construction without joints, 100% ‘greenness’ etc, it is important to mention that the homes tend to be cooler by about 15 degrees Fahrenheit compared to the ambient temperature, which is a very important factor in the hotter climes of Northern Kenya.             </p>

                The terrain itself is a challenge in this country due to the rocky outcroppings of Basalt formations. Yet, due to the quake dangers in this zone, ‘RIST HOMES’ concept is being employed here. Additionally, this country gets very little rainfall, and hence, via our proprietary concept of ‘zero discharge---input or output’, we are able to solve the water problem here. Our first phase of 1,600 homes will be built on about 90 acres of land.</p>

                <br>
                Using ‘RIST HOMES’, we are building a community of about 1.5m sq. ft. The community will have its own school, post office, medical clinic, and shopping center in the beautiful Southern Indian town of Madurai. Additionally, in the city of Bangalore, the technological capital of India, it is proposed to build about 10,000 homes for the economically disadvantaged, using this technology.             </p>
